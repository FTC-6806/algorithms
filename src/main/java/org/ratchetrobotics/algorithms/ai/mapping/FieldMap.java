/**
 * The FieldMap's purpose is to take data from a GeoJSON file,
 * and present it to the AStarPathFinder in an easy-to-use way.
 * Cool things which it will be able to do:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Generate a triangulated-graph representation of any GeoJSON file!</li>
 *     <li>Map from a triangulated-graph to actual coordinates!</li>
 *     <li>Add pushpins for important locations!</li>
 * </ul>
